    Chapter one talks about the importance of taking responsibility
  for one's code. Owning up to mistakes can be hard but if you do
  not it can cause more issues in the future. By taking ownership
  of your work you can easily discuss issues and solutions without
  puting blame on other people. It stops being an issue of who did
  this and becomes a chance to find solutions.
    Software entophy is the disorder that can occur in software. Many people
  working on the same project can cause chaos in the code. As long as
  all members are commited to cleaning up the software and taking responsibility
  entophy can be kept at bay. By fixing issues as you see them and not leaving
  issues unfixed you can reduce the chaos and clean up the software.</p>
    Communication is another important theme of chapter one. Communication
  is impotant because It allows for instruction, feedback, and ideas to flow.
  Communication is important to understand what the customer wants and what your
  teamates need to succeed.
